tv.js : Apple TV for Torrent Streaming
====

![screen](https://raw.github.com/SamyPesse/movies/master/screens/2.png)

A Smart TV application to stream movies using BitTorrent. (Yes it actually streams them in order even though it's BitTorrent)

Tv.js used iTunes' API to find movies, isoHunt to search torrents and BitTorrent to downloading/stream movies.

It runs as a server which can run on a Raspberry Pi and the UI can be controlled from a smartphone (no need of keyboard or mouse).

Tv.js is the result of a 24h personal hackathon (7th of July 2013) by Aaron O'Mullan (@AaronO) and me (@SamyPesse).

It's designed to run on a TV screen (through HDMI), but works just as well on a laptop. (it's entirely usuable with keyboard controls alone)

You can see a video of it working here on Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j71NCZnLffg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j71NCZnLffg)

Downloading copyrighted material through torrents may be illegal in your country.

## How to install it on your TV ?

This application has been built and designed to run on a TV screen using a Raspberry Pi.

### Software Stack:

    Raspbian OS â€“ a Debian distro specially made for the rPi
    NodeJs
    tv.js
    ffmpeg
    Chromium Browser

### Steps :

#### 1. Install Raspbian & NodeJs

Follow [this tutorial](http://blog.rueedlinger.ch/2013/03/raspberry-pi-and-nodejs-basic-setup/) to install Raspbian and Node Js on your Raspberry Pi

#### 2. Install Chromium

    sudo apt-get install chromium-browser
    sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer

#### 3. Install tv.js

    export DISPLAY=:0.0
    git clone https://github.com/SamyPesse/tv.js.git && cd tv.js
    make install

#### 4. Build and run tv.js

    make build
    make run
    chromium --kiosk http://localhost:8888


## How to install ffmpeg ?

tv.js needs ffmpeg to convert the videos to ogv, make sure you have ffmpeg installed with the necessary codecs.

#### Mac OS X :

    brew install ffmpeg --with-fdk-aac --with-ffplay --with-freetype --with-frei0r --with-libass --with-libvo-aacenc --with-libvorbis --with-libvpx --with-opencore-amr --with-openjpeg --with-opus --with-rtmpdump --with-schroedinger --with-speex --with-theora --with-tools


## Todo
    - Use IMBD or another API with a bigger movie collection that Itunes'
    - Cache converted videos
    - Improve overall stability
    - Improve torrent picking algorithm (by seeds/leechers, size, votes, video format ...)
    - Package using NodeWebkit for Windows/Mac/Linux/Raspberry PI
    - Add other awesone stuff !
